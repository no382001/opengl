<h1>Instructions</h1>

The primary requirement for running the tutorials is a video card that
supports at least OpenGL-3.3. The code provided by the tutorials was
developed on Ubuntu Linux using NetBeans as a primary development
platform. You should be able to compile it without NetBeans by simply
running 'make' from the command line. The following libraries/apps are
required (all of them available via apt-get):<br>
<br>

<ol>
  <li><big><big>g++</big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>freeglut3-dev</big></big></li>
  <li><big><big>libglew1.5-dev<br>
    </big></big></li>
</ol>
<big><big><br>
The code was tested only on my machine that has the following details:<br>
<br>
CPU: Intel Core 2 Extreme QX9770<br>
OS: Ubuntu Linux 11.04 64 bits<br>
Video card: GIGABYTE NVIDIA GeForce GTX550 TI<br>
Driver version: 275.21<br>
<br>
Please let me know of any problems to compile/run the tutorials on
other platforms (fixes will be greatly appreciated!).<br>
